Roadwatch is a community-driven web application that allows
citizens to report road damage like potholes and cracks. Users can
upload photos, descriptions of the damage. This crowdsourced
information is then collected in a central dashboard, which is
accessible to local government and public works departments. The
system uses geolocalization to pinpoint the exact location of the
damage, enabling timely and efficient repairs. By empowering citizens
to actively participate in road maintenance, Roadwatch aims to
enhance road safety, reduce vehicle damage, and create a more
responsive and accountable road management system.
